# Blockchain Integration Guidelines

## Smart Contract Development Standards

### Contract Architecture
- Use OpenZeppelin contracts as base implementations
- Implement upgradeable patterns using proxy contracts
- Separate business logic from data storage
- Use libraries for common functionality
- Implement proper access control with role-based permissions

### Security Best Practices
- Follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern
- Implement reentrancy guards for external calls
- Use SafeMath for arithmetic operations (Solidity <0.8.0)
- Validate all inputs and state transitions
- Implement emergency pause mechanisms

### Gas Optimization
- Use appropriate data types (uint256 vs uint8)
- Pack struct variables efficiently
- Use events instead of storage for non-critical data
- Implement batch operations where possible
- Optimize loop operations and avoid unbounded loops

## Chainlink VRF Integration

### VRF Implementation Pattern
```solidity
contract RaffleContract is VRFConsumerBase {
    bytes32 internal keyHash;
    uint256 internal fee;
    
    mapping(bytes32 => uint256) public requestToRaffleId;
    
    function requestRandomness(uint256 raffleId) internal {
        require(LINK.balanceOf(address(this)) >= fee, "Not enough LINK");
        bytes32 requestId = requestRandomness(keyHash, fee);
        requestToRaffleId[requestId] = raffleId;
    }
    
    function fulfillRandomness(bytes32 requestId, uint256 randomness) internal override {
        uint256 raffleId = requestToRaffleId[requestId];
        selectWinners(raffleId, randomness);
    }
}
```

### VRF Configuration
- Use appropriate key hash for the network
- Maintain sufficient LINK balance for requests
- Implement proper error handling for failed requests
- Monitor VRF request status and retry if necessary
- Use subscription model for cost optimization

## Wallet Management

### Internal Wallet Strategy
- Generate HD wallets for each user using BIP44 standard
- Encrypt private keys using AES-256 with user-specific salt
- Store encrypted keys in secure database with proper access controls
- Use hardware security modules (HSM) for key management in production
- Implement key rotation policies for enhanced security

### Transaction Management
```rust
pub struct WalletManager {
    provider: Arc<Provider<Http>>,
    signer: Arc<LocalWallet>,
}

impl WalletManager {
    pub async fn send_transaction(&self, tx: TransactionRequest) -> Result<TxHash> {
        let tx = tx.gas_price(self.get_optimal_gas_price().await?);
        let pending_tx = self.signer.send_transaction(tx, None).await?;
        Ok(pending_tx.tx_hash())
    }
    
    pub async fn get_optimal_gas_price(&self) -> Result<U256> {
        // Implement gas price optimization logic
        let gas_price = self.provider.get_gas_price().await?;
        Ok(gas_price * 110 / 100) // 10% buffer
    }
}
```

## Event Monitoring and Processing

### Event Listening Architecture
- Use WebSocket connections for real-time event monitoring
- Implement event filtering to reduce unnecessary processing
- Use block confirmations to ensure event finality
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed event processing
- Maintain event processing state for recovery

### Event Processing Pipeline
```rust
pub struct EventProcessor {
    provider: Arc<Provider<Ws>>,
    contract: Arc<RaffleContract<Provider<Ws>>>,
    db: Arc<PgPool>,
}

impl EventProcessor {
    pub async fn start_monitoring(&self) -> Result<()> {
        let events = self.contract.events().from_block(BlockNumber::Latest);
        let mut stream = events.stream().await?;
        
        while let Some(event) = stream.next().await {
            match event {
                Ok(event) => self.process_event(event).await?,
                Err(e) => log::error!("Event stream error: {}", e),
            }
        }
        Ok(())
    }
    
    async fn process_event(&self, event: RaffleContractEvents) -> Result<()> {
        match event {
            RaffleContractEvents::BoxPurchasedFilter(box_purchased) => {
                self.handle_box_purchased(box_purchased).await?;
            }
            RaffleContractEvents::WinnerSelectedFilter(winner_selected) => {
                self.handle_winner_selected(winner_selected).await?;
            }
        }
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

## Transaction Reliability

### Transaction Confirmation Strategy
- Wait for multiple block confirmations before considering transactions final
- Implement transaction receipt checking
- Handle transaction failures and resubmission
- Monitor transaction pool for stuck transactions
- Implement gas price bumping for urgent transactions

### Error Handling and Recovery
```rust
pub async fn execute_with_retry<F, T>(
    operation: F,
    max_retries: u32,
) -> Result<T>
where
    F: Fn() -> Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output = Result<T>> + Send>>,
{
    let mut attempts = 0;
    loop {
        match operation().await {
            Ok(result) => return Ok(result),
            Err(e) if attempts < max_retries => {
                attempts += 1;
                let delay = Duration::from_secs(2_u64.pow(attempts));
                tokio::time::sleep(delay).await;
            }
            Err(e) => return Err(e),
        }
    }
}
```

## Network Configuration

### Multi-Network Support
- Support multiple blockchain networks (Polygon, Ethereum, BSC)
- Implement network-specific configurations
- Handle network switching and failover
- Monitor network health and congestion
- Implement cross-chain compatibility where needed

### Network Configuration Structure
```rust
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
pub struct NetworkConfig {
    pub name: String,
    pub chain_id: u64,
    pub rpc_url: String,
    pub ws_url: String,
    pub contract_address: Address,
    pub vrf_coordinator: Address,
    pub link_token: Address,
    pub key_hash: [u8; 32],
    pub fee: U256,
}

pub struct NetworkManager {
    configs: HashMap<String, NetworkConfig>,
    active_network: String,
}
```

## Smart Contract Deployment

### Deployment Pipeline
- Use Hardhat or Foundry for contract compilation and deployment
- Implement deployment scripts with proper verification
- Use deterministic deployment addresses where possible
- Implement contract verification on block explorers
- Maintain deployment artifacts and ABIs

### Contract Upgrades
- Use OpenZeppelin's upgradeable contracts pattern
- Implement proper initialization functions
- Test upgrade scenarios thoroughly
- Implement governance mechanisms for upgrades
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible

### Deployment Configuration
```javascript
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    polygon: {
      url: process.env.POLYGON_RPC_URL,
      accounts: [process.env.DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY],
      gasPrice: 30000000000, // 30 gwei
    },
    mumbai: {
      url: process.env.MUMBAI_RPC_URL,
      accounts: [process.env.DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY],
      gasPrice: 1000000000, // 1 gwei
    },
  },
  etherscan: {
    apiKey: {
      polygon: process.env.POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY,
      polygonMumbai: process.env.POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY,
    },
  },
};
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test all contract functions with various inputs
- Test access control and permission systems
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use fuzzing for comprehensive input testing
- Achieve 100% code coverage for critical functions

### Integration Testing
- Test contract interactions with VRF coordinator
- Test event emission and off-chain processing
- Test upgrade scenarios and data migration
- Test gas usage under various conditions
- Test contract behavior under network congestion

### Security Testing
- Conduct static analysis with tools like Slither
- Perform manual security reviews
- Test for common vulnerabilities (reentrancy, overflow, etc.)
- Conduct formal verification for critical functions
- Engage third-party security auditors

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Contract Monitoring
- Monitor contract balance and LINK token balance
- Track gas usage and optimization opportunities
- Monitor event emission and processing delays
- Alert on failed transactions or unusual activity
- Track contract upgrade events and changes

### Performance Metrics

- Network congestion impact

### Alerting Configuration
```rust
pub struct BlockchainMonitor {
    contract_address: Address,
    alert_thresholds: AlertThresholds,
    notification_service: Arc<NotificationService>,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct AlertThresholds {
    pub min_link_balance: U256,
    pub max_gas_price: U256,
    pub max_confirmation_time: Duration,
    pub max_failed_transactions: u32,
}
```
