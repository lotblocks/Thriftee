# Technical Architecture Guidelines

## System Architecture Principles

### Microservices Architecture
- Separate services for distinct business domains (User, Raffle, Payment, Credit)
- Each service owns its data and business logic
- Services communicate via well-defined APIs
- Independent deployment and scaling capabilities
- Fault isolation between services

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Use events for loose coupling between services
- Implement event sourcing for critical business events
- Use message queues for reliable event delivery
- Enable real-time updates through WebSocket broadcasting
- Maintain audit trails through event logs

### Blockchain Integration Patterns
- Backend services act as blockchain clients
- Internal wallet management for user transactions
- Event listening for blockchain state changes
- Retry mechanisms for failed blockchain transactions
- Gas optimization strategies
