This document outlines the requirements for a unit shopping platform that combines traditional e-commerce with raffle-style mechanics to create an engaging, transparent, and fair shopping experience. The platform allows users to purchase "boxes" or "units" of items using credits, with winners selected through a verifiable blockchain-based random selection process. The system ensures no financial loss for participants through a comprehensive credit system and guarantees transparency through blockchain technology.
